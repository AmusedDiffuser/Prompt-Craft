# Virtual Computer

### Pinokio is a ***virtual computer***.

It has all the components of a traditional computer, except every component is written from scratch to facilitate the main goal, which is to build the ultimate application that can live.

- **[File System](https://docs.pinokio.computer/fs/overview)**: Where and how Pinokio stores files.
- **[Processor](https://docs.pinokio.computer/processor/overview)**: How Pinokio runs tasks.
- **[Memory](https://docs.pinokio.computer/memory/overview)**: How Pinokio implements a state machine using its built-in native memory.
- **[API](https://docs.pinokio.computer/api/overview)**: Core APIs shipped with Pinokio.
- **[Kernel Programming](https://docs.pinokio.computer/custom/what)**: Hack the Pinokio kernel to build custom APIs.
- **[Lifeform](https://docs.pinokio.computer/ai/overview)**: How to build a fully autonomous application that evolves on its own.

### Turing complete script

Pinokio has a native scripting language written in JSON, extending JSON-RPC, which means anything you can express as an API can be expressed with Pinokio script

---

### Built-in binaries

Pinokio ships with many of the common binaries you need when installing many AI applications, including:

1. Node.js / NPM
2. Python/Pip
3. Git
4. etc. (more to come)

It takes care of all the convoluted steps one must jump through (installing the prerequisites) so the users can simply try new apps and engines with one click.

### Automate Everything! There's a script for that...

Pinokio is an application that can autonomously read, write, process, and execute anything on your computer, with a simple scripting language. Pinokio can:

- compose files
- download files
- accumulate data
- install libraries and other applications
- run shell commands
- make network requests
- publish files
- browse the internet
- and pretty much anything a human can do on a computer, without requiring humans.

### Terminal apps in the browser

Any CLI (command line interface) apps can be ported to run in the Pinokio browser. Some examples:

- **installation scripts**: pip install, npm install, etc.
- **python scripts**: any python script can be run with one click. No terminal required.
- **any shell command**: mkdir, curl, git, etc.
- **anything**: anything that can run in a terminal can be automated with Pinokio, in the browser.

### Servers in the browser

Running a server on a computer is not a trivial task. You need to open a terminal, and run a bunch of commands to start the server, and keep the terminal open to keep them running.

#### Not anymore.

Pinokio lets you can launch servers and daemons directly in the app, with one click.

Now anyone can run powerful server based apps on their own computer, effotlessly:

- **Database Systems**: Elasticsearch, MongoDB, RocksDB, Vector Databases, etc.
- **Decentralized Applications**: Bitcoin, IPFS, etc.
- **AI Servers**: StableDiffusion Web UI, Gradio, Langchain apps, etc.
- **Web apps**: Any web apps, really, can be run in the Pinokio browser.
- **Bots**: Spin up bots that run in the background, in the Pinokio browser, with one click.
